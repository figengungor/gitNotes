### Commit

"A good commit message is composed of two parts: a short message, less than 72 characters long, which briefly states (in active voice) the change being made; and a much longer, optional description, which is separated from the brief description by a newline."

Android Studio >> Commit Changes dialog >> Commit message text box

You can separate short message and optional description with new line.
